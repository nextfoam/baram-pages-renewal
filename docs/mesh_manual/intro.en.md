# Introduction

## What is BaramMesh

BaramMesh is mesh generation module of BARAM. It uses OpenFOAM's utilities _blockMesh_ and _snappyHexMesh_ to generate mesh. Geometry of STL files can be imported. Simple geomertry as hexahedron, sphere, and cylinder can be created in it. It can generate octree-style three-dimensional mesh including boundary layer and can create regions, cell zones, interfaces, and baffles.

OpenFOAM's _snappyHexMesh_ utility create mesh with the following steps

1) Create a structured type background mesh that covers the entire domain with _blockMesh_ utility.

2) Refine mesh where you need and remove mesh of outside domain. This process is called castellation.

3) Move mesh points onto the surface to achieve the correct geometry. This process is called snap.

4) Add boundary layer mesh from surfaces.

After the first step, a mesh is created in the constant/polyMesh folder, and folders 1, 2, and 3 are created after every 2, 3, and 4 steps.

BaramMesh breaks down the above process into seven steps, including

1. Geometry : Import STL file or create primitive geometry
2. Region : Define regions to create mesh
3. Base Grid : Create base mesh
4. Castellation : refine mesh and remove mesh outside domain
5. Snap : Move mesh points onto surface
6. Boundary Layer : Create boundary layer mesh
7. Export : Export mesh in a folder format that BaramFlow can read.

The seven steps above are sequential.

When a step is completed, it is locked and you move on to the next step. If you want to go back to a previous step and work with different settings, you need to go to that step and unlock it. Unlocking delete all work done after that step.
