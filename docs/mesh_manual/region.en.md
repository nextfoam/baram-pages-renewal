# Region

In [2.Region], you specify the region where the mesh will be created. If you enter the coordinates of a single point, the mesh will be created inside the closed surface enclosing the point.

To create a multi-region mesh, specify as many points as there are regions.

Clicking the (+) in the upper right corner creates a region, specifying the coordinates of the point and whether it is a fluid or solid. The coordinates of the points can be entered manually or by moving the mouse to the point where the light green lines in the graphics window meet.
