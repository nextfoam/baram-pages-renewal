+ Drag Direction : (0.965926, 0, 0.258819)
+ Boundaries : spaceShuttle


### Initialization

Enter the value and click the Initialize button at the bottom. Then click the [File]-[Save] menu to save the case file.

### Run

Change the values as shown below, and click [Start Calculation] button.

+ Number of Iterations : 3000
+ Courant Number : 0.1
+ Save Interval : 500

For supersonic flows, starting with a high Courant Number often results in divergence, so starting with a small value and increasing it gradually as the calculation stabilizes can speed up convergence. During the calculation, you can modify the value in [Run Condition] and press the [Update Configuration] button in [Run] to apply it. In this example, we started with 0.1 and increased the value to 1 at around 400 iterations and then to 100 at around 700 iterations.

### Monitor

Monitor flowrate at nozzle inlet. Select [Add]-[Surface] and set values as follows

+ Report Type : Mas Flow Rate
+ Surface : inlet


### Initialization

Set values as follows

+ Velocity : (0, 0, 0)

+ Temperature : 300
+ Turbulence
    + Scale of Velocity : 100
    + Turbulent Intensity : 0.1
    + Turbulent Viscosity Ratio : 1 

The solver is unstable at the beginning of the calculation because of the large difference between the flow variables in the region through which the nozzle flow passes and the outer region. To solve this problem, set the initialization values for the nozzle flow section separately.

Click [Initialization]-[Advanced]-[Section]-[Create] and set the following settings.

+ region1 - Hex
    + Min. point : (-0.15, -0.1, -0.1)
    + Max. point : (0.12, 0.065 0.1)
